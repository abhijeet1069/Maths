    "A rectangular matrix is in echelon form (or row echelon form) if it has below 3 properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All zero rows (if any) are at the bottom.\n",
    "2. The first nonzero element (called a pivot) in each row is to the right of the pivot in the row above.\n",
    "3. The pivot (leading coefficient) in a nonzero row is **nonzero**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a matrix satisfies below additional conditions then it is in reduced echelon form(or reduced row echelon form):\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Every pivot is **1**.\n",
    "5. Each pivot is the **only nonzero entry** in its column.\n",
