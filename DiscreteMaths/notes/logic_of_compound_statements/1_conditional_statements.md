# The Logic of Compound statements

## Proposition

A statement or proposition is a sentence that is true or false but not both.

## Conditional statements

If p then q , p -> q

A conditional statement that is true by the fact that its hypothesis is false id often called vauously true or true by
default.

p -> q = ~p v q

## Converse, Inverse, Contrapositive

- Contrapositive of p -> q = ~q -> ~p, which is equivalent
- Converse of p -> q = q->p
- Inverse of p -> q = ~p -> ~q

The converse and inverse of a conditional statement are logically equivalent to each other.
