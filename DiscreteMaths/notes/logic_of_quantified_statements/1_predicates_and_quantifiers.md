# Predicates and Quantfied Statements

## Predicate

A predicate is a sentence that contains a finite number of variables and becomes a statement when specific values are
substituted for the variables. The domain of a predicate variable is the set of all values that may be substituted in
place of the variable.

## Universal Quantifier ∀

Another way to obtain statements from predicates is to add quantifiers. The symbol ∀ is called universal qunatifer.
Depending on the context, its read as "for every", "for each", "for any", "given any", "for all".

## Existential Quantifier ∃

Depending on the context its read as "there exists","there is atleast one","for some","for atleast one"

## Universal Conditional Statements

∀x, if P(x) then Q(x)
